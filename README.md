# Neighborhood Map

This is the fifth project of Full Stack Web Develper Nanodegree by Udacity.

You can check live version of this project [here][live].

## Getting started

To get started this project, you just need to clone it and open index.html in your browser.
You can also start with local server in project directory like below.

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

After that, you can connect to ``http://localhost:8000/index.html``

But Yelp API is only worked in [live site][live], because I used backend server to protect API keys.

If you want to use Yelp API as I used, please refer [this][1].
